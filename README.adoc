= Red Hat Integration: AMQ Streams Workshop

=== Introduction

link:https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/integration/what-is-apache-kafka[Apache Kafka] has become the leading platform for building real-time data pipelines.  Today, Kafka is heavily used for developing event-driven applications,  where it lets services communicate with each other through events. Using Kubernetes for this type of workload requires adding specialized  components such as Kubernetes Operators and connectors to bridge the  rest of your systems and applications to the Kafka ecosystem.

To respond to business demands quickly and efficiently, you need a way  to integrate applications and data spread across your enterprise. link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/amq[Red Hat AMQ] — based on open source communities like Apache ActiveMQ and Apache  Kafka — is a flexible messaging platform that delivers information  reliably, enabling real-time integration and connecting the Internet of  Things (IoT).

AMQ streams, a link:https://www.redhat.com/en/products/integration[Red Hat Integration] component, makes Apache Kafka “OpenShift native” through the use of  powerful operators that simplify the deployment, configuration,  management, and use of Apache Kafka on Red Hat OpenShift.
