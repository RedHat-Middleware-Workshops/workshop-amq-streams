This lab walks through setting up mirrormaker and testing the setup to ensure that messages sent to one cluster are being replicated/mirrored in the mirrormaker target cluster.

We will use the first cluster previously created in this workshop as the "source" cluster.
We will create the mirror-maker "target" cluster.


Prerequisites: +
1. You have 'my-cluster-kafka' installed per previous labs +
2. You have 'my-topic' created per previous labs +
3. Make sure you are logged in to Openshift with the oc client +


Steps +


    Step 1: Run this to create the "target" cluster. This will be the cluster that mirror maker writes to.

    oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kasriniv/workshop-amq-streams/master/labs/lab07-mirrormaker/kafka-ephemeral-mtarget.yaml

    Make sure the pods have come up fine.

    Step 2: create the mirror maker configuration

    oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kasriniv/workshop-amq-streams/master/labs/lab07-mirrormaker/kafka-mirror-maker-lab.yaml

    Make sure the pods have come up fine.


Testing via command line +

 NOTE : The producer and consumer are from the mirror maker's perspective. Messages will be read from the producer (in mirrormaker config) and published to consumer. +


   Go to the Openshift webconsole->Applications->Pods and pick the my-cluster-mtarget-kafka-0 ->Terminal and run +
   ./bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --zookeeper localhost:2181 +
   This will confirm that my-topic was created automatically. +


   Send some messages to my-topic on my-kafka-cluster +
  ./bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic my-topic +


   See these messages being replicated to my-topic on my-cluster-mtarget-kafka +
   ./bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server my-cluster-mtarget-kafka-bootstrap:9092   --topic my-topic --from-beginning



Testing via supplied generic producer and consumer SpringBoot  +

   Deploy the app : generic producer to the Openshift cluster
   git clone
   cd <......>/testapp/generic-producer
   mvn -DskipTests fabric8:deploy

   To send messages to my-topic (Edit below curl for your Openshift route)
   curl -X POST http://generic-myproject.apps.kasriniv-b22e.openshiftworkshop.com/camel/posttotopic -d 'hello' -H 'Content-Type: text'


  Deploy the app: generic consumer to the Openshift cluster

  cd <......>/testapp/generic-consumer
  mvn -DskipTests fabric8:deploy

  Edit the consumer.html line 29 to point to the Openshift route for the consumer service.
  Now use your local browser to render consumer.html and hit 'Submit Request'
  You should see an HMTL page with a table of all messages.
