== Production-ready topologies: sizing and persistence

In the previous module, we have set up a simple Apache Kafka cluster.
It is suitable for development and experimentation, but not for a production setting.
In this module you will learn how to use AMQ Streams for configuring a Kafka cluster for production usage, in particular sizing and persistence settings.

=== Some words on size and persistence

Configuring your Kafka cluster depends on a number of factors, and in particular of your development and production requirements for throughput and scalability, but there are a few principles to observe:

* Making sure that you deploy at least 3 Kafka brokers for scaling and HA
* Making sure that topics are replicated on at least two nodes
* Making sure that your Zookeeper ensemble has at least 3 nodes
* Making sure that the data of your Kafka cluster is persistent

Our ephemeral cluster created in the previous module meets some but not all of these criteria: it has the minimum number of nodes for both Kafka and Zookeeper, but it not persistent.
Plus, we really had no control over sizing - we just used a default!

=== Configuring the size of your Kafka cluster deployments

AMQ Streams treats an Apache Kafka cluster deployment as a custom resource and controls the configuration of an Apache Kafka cluster through a Custom Resource Definition (CRD).
Let's take a quick look at the resource descriptor for the cluster we just deployed:

----
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1alpha1
kind: Kafka
metadata:
  name: simple-cluster
spec:
  kafka:
    replicas: 1
    listeners:
      plain: {}
      tls: {}
    config:
      offsets.topic.replication.factor: 1
      transaction.state.log.replication.factor: 1
      transaction.state.log.min.isr: 1
    storage:
      type: ephemeral
  zookeeper:
    replicas: 1
    storage:
      type: ephemeral
  entityOperator:
    topicOperator: {}
    userOperator: {}
----

Let's take a look at a few of the cluster properties.
The cluster has:

* a name: `metadata.name: my-cluster`
* a number of kafka replicas: `spec.kafka.replicas: 1`
* storage configuration for the Kafka cluster: `spec.kafka.storage: ephemeral`
* configurations for listeners and configuration parameters for the brokers (e.g. replication settings)
* a number of zookeeper replicas: `spec.zookeeper.replicas: 1`
* storage configuration for the ZooKeeper cluster: `spec.zookeeper.storage: ephemeral`

=== Configuring a cluster of a given size and persistence

While a single-broker ephemeral cluster is good enough for development and experimentation, it is definitely not a good option for production and staging workloads.
A healthy cluster must have more than one broker for HA and throughput, and must persist its data on a persistent filesystem.

First let's check if the previously deployed cluster is still there.

----
oc get kafka
----

You might get an empty result, but in case you don't, just remove the existing cluster.

----
oc delete kafka simple-cluster
----

Now let's create a new resource.
The definition of the cluster is below:

----
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1alpha1
kind: Kafka
metadata:
  name: production-ready
spec:
  kafka:
    replicas: 3
    listeners:
      plain: {}
      tls: {}
    config:
      offsets.topic.replication.factor: 3
      transaction.state.log.replication.factor: 3
      transaction.state.log.min.isr: 2
    storage:
      type: persistent-claim
      size: 3Gi
      deleteClaim: false
  zookeeper:
    replicas: 3
    storage:
      type: persistent-claim
      size: 1Gi
      deleteClaim: false
  entityOperator:
    topicOperator: {}
    userOperator: {}
----

Let's deploy this new resource.

----
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatWorkshops/workshop-amq-streams/master/configurations/clusters/production-ready.yaml
----

The cluster `production-ready` has the minimal settings for a highly available, persistent cluster.

* 3 Kafka broker nodes - this is the minimum recommended number for a production deployment
* 3 ZooKeeper nodes - this is the minimum recommended number for a production deployments
* `persistent-claim` storage that ensures that persistent volumes are allocated to Kafka and ZooKeeper instances

Note that while the minimum number is 3 for both, the number of Kafka brokers is likely to be different from the number of ZooKeeper nodes.
The latter may be less than the number of Kafka brokers.
Other settings control the replication factors for offsets and transaction logs.
A minimum of two is recommended.

==== Scaling up the cluster

Let us scale up the cluster.
A corresponding resource would look like below (note that the only property that changes is `spec.kafka.replicas`).

----
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1alpha1
kind: Kafka
metadata:
  name: production-ready
spec:
  kafka:
    replicas: 5
    listeners:
      plain: {}
      tls: {}
    config:
      offsets.topic.replication.factor: 3
      transaction.state.log.replication.factor: 3
      transaction.state.log.min.isr: 2
    storage:
      type: persistent-claim
      size: 3Gi
      deleteClaim: false
  zookeeper:
    replicas: 3
    storage:
      type: persistent-claim
      size: 1Gi
      deleteClaim: false
  entityOperator:
    topicOperator: {}
    userOperator: {}
----

Notice the only change being the number of nodes.
Let's apply this new configuration:

----
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatWorkshops/workshop-amq-streams/master/configurations/clusters/production-ready-5-nodes.yaml
----

Notice the number of pods of the Kafka cluster increasing to 5 and the corresponding persistent claims.
Now let's scale down the cluster again.

----
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatWorkshops/workshop-amq-streams/master/configurations/clusters/production-ready.yaml
----

Notice the number of pods of the Kafka cluster decreasing back to 3.
The persistent claims for nodes 3 and 4 are still active.
What does this mean?
Let's scale up the cluster again.

----
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatWorkshops/workshop-amq-streams/master/configurations/clusters/production-ready-5-nodes.yaml
----

Notice the number of pods increasing back to 5 and the corresponding persistent volume claims being reallocated to the existing nodes.
This means that the newly started instances will resume from where the previous instances 3 and 4 left off.

Three broker nodes will be sufficient for our lab, so we can scale things down again:

----
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatWorkshops/workshop-amq-streams/master/configurations/clusters/production-ready.yaml
----
